The configurations in this page can be set from several sources in the following order:

1. the [operating system's environment variables]; for instance, an environment variable can be set with
   `export OAUTH_ENABLED="true"`
2. the [Java system properties]; for example, a Java system property can be set using
   `System.setProperty("OAUTH_ENABLED", "true")`
3. a **.properties** file placed under CLASSPATH. This file can be put under `src/main/resources` source directory with
   contents, for example, `OAUTH_ENABLED=true`

Note that environment config has higher priority than Java system properties. Java system properties have higher
priority than file based configuration.
