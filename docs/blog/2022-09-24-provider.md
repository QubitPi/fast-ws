A **Provider** is an interface defined in [JSR 330][JSR 330 Provider]. It is part of the _general_ dependency
injection concept in Java.

Whether we are on Java SR or EE, Provider will always be loadable from classpath. For example, the [HK2] is an
implementation of JSR-330 in a JavaSE environment and it conforms to the JSR 330 standard by loading the
[Provider][JSR 330 Provider] in its implementations.

**@Provider**, on the other hand, is a
[_Java EE/Jakarta EE concept_](https://github.com/jakartaee/rest/blob/master/jaxrs-api/src/main/java/jakarta/ws/rs/ext/Provider.java).
If we are developing Java EE applications, we can use both (`Provider` & `@Provider`) at the same time.
