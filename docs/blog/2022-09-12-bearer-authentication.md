**Bearer authentication** (also called **token authentication**) is an
[HTTP authentication scheme][HTTP authentication scheme] that involves security tokens called bearer tokens. The name
"Bearer authentication" can be understood as "give access to the bearer of this token." The bearer token is a cryptic
string, usually generated by the server in response to a login request. The client must send this token in the
`Authorization` header when making requests to protected resources:

```bash
Authorization: Bearer <token>
```

The Bearer authentication scheme was originally created as part of [OAuth 2.0][OAuth 2.0] in [RFC 6750][RFC 6750], but
is sometimes also used on its own. Similarly to [Basic authentication][Basic authentication], Bearer authentication
should only be used over HTTPS (SSL).
