__FastWS__ is a [JSR 370] webservice template that lets us spin up Java webservice quickly through [GitHub templates].
One can think of FastWS as the Jersey/Jetty version of [Spring Initializr]. At the end of the day, FastWS helps
organization to improve the velocity and quality of their teams' work

âœ¨ Features
-----------

- Out-of-the-box healthcheck endpoint
- Docusaurus-based documentation site freely hosted on GitHub Pages
- Dockerized webservice
- ELK application monitoring
- Flexible webservice configuration

ðŸš€ Quick Start
--------------

Please make sure Docker is installed
([_Installing Docker_](https://docker.qubitpi.org/desktop/setup/install/mac-install/)), then execute this on-click
commands:

```console
docker run --name=fast-ws -it -p 8080:8080 jack20191124/fast-ws
```

That's it. A healthcheck endpoint can be pinned with

```console
curl -v localhost:8080/v1/data/healthcheck
```

which would gave

```console
$ curl -v localhost:8080/v1/data/healthcheck
*   Trying 127.0.0.1:8080...
* Connected to localhost (127.0.0.1) port 8080 (#0)
> GET /v1/data/healthcheck HTTP/1.1
> Host: localhost:8080
> User-Agent: curl/7.85.0
> Accept: */*
>
* Mark bundle as not supporting multiuse
< HTTP/1.1 200 OK
< Content-Length: 0
< Server: Jetty(11.0.15)
<
* Connection #0 to host localhost left intact
```

Developer can now start adding business values without repeating the time-consuming scaffolding works. To proceed from
here, including getting and developing the webservice source code, please refer to the [documentation][Documentation]
for details.
