For example, the code:\\n\\n```java\\nStringBuffer buffer = new StringBuffer();\\n```\\n\\ncreates a new `StringBuffer` and stores a strong reference to it in the variable `buffer`. Yes, yes, this is kiddie\\nstuff, but bear with me. _The important part about strong references -- the part that makes them \\"strong\\" -- is how they\\ninteract with the garbage collector_. Specifically, if an object is reachable via a chain of strong references (strongly\\nreachable), it is not eligible for garbage collection. As you don\'t want the garbage collector destroying objects you\'re\\nworking on, this is normally exactly what you want.\\n\\nWhen Strong References are Too Strong\\n-------------------------------------\\n\\nIt\'s not uncommon for an application to use classes that it can\'t reasonably extend. The class might simply be marked\\n`final`, or it could be something more complicated, such as an interface returned by a factory method backed by an\\nunknown (and possibly even unknowable) number of concrete implementations. Suppose you have to use a class `Widget` and,\\nfor whatever reason, it isn\'t possible or practical to extend `Widget` to add new functionality.\\n\\nWhat happens when you need to keep track of extra information about the object? In this case, suppose we find ourselves\\nneeding to keep track of each Widget\'s serial number, but the Widget class doesn\'t actually have a serial number\\nproperty -- and because Widget isn\'t extensible, we can\'t add one. No problem at all, that\'s what `HashMaps` are for:\\n\\n```java\\nserialNumberMap.put(widget, widgetSerialNumber);\\n```\\n\\nThis might look okay on the surface, but the strong reference to widget will almost certainly cause problems. We have to\\nknow (with 100% certainty) when a particular Widget\'s serial number is no longer needed, so we can remove its entry from\\nthe map. Otherwise we\'re going to have a memory leak (if we don\'t remove Widgets when we should) or we\'re going to\\ninexplicably find ourselves missing serial numbers (if we remove Widgets that we\'re still using). If these problems\\nsound familiar, they should: they are exactly the problems that users of non-garbage-collected languages face when\\ntrying to manage memory, and we\'re not supposed to have to worry about this in a more civilized language like Java.\\n\\nAnother common problem with strong references is caching, particular with very large structures like images. Suppose you\\nhave an application which has to work with user-supplied images, like the web site design tool I work on. Naturally you\\nwant to cache these images, because loading them from disk is very expensive and you want to avoid the possibility of\\nhaving two copies of the (potentially gigantic) image in memory at once. Because an image cache is supposed to prevent\\nus from reloading images when we don\'t absolutely need to, you will quickly realize that the cache should always contain\\na reference to any image which is already in memory. With ordinary strong references, though, that reference itself will\\nforce the image to remain in memory, which requires you (just as above) to somehow determine when the image is no longer\\nneeded in memory and remove it from the cache, so that it becomes eligible for garbage collection. Once again you are\\nforced to duplicate the behavior of the garbage collector and manually determine whether or not an object should be in\\nmemory.\\n\\nWeak References\\n---------------\\n\\nA **weak reference**, simply put, is a reference that isn\'t strong enough to force an object to remain in memory. Weak\\nreferences allow you to leverage the garbage collector\'s ability to determine reachability for you, so you don\'t have to\\ndo it yourself. You create a weak reference like this:\\n\\n```java\\nWeakReference weakWidget = new WeakReference(widget);\\n```\\n\\nand then elsewhere in the code you can use `weakWidget.get()` to get the actual Widget object. Of course the weak\\nreference isn\'t strong enough to prevent garbage collection, so you may find (if there are no strong references to the\\nwidget) that `weakWidget.get()` suddenly starts returning `null`.\\n\\nTo solve the \\"widget serial number\\" problem above, the easiest thing to do is use the built-in `WeakHashMap` class.\\n`WeakHashMap` works exactly like `HashMap`, except that the keys (not the values!) are referred to using weak\\nreferences. If a `WeakHashMap` key becomes garbage, its entry is removed automatically. This avoids the pitfalls\\ndescribed earlier and requires no changes other than the switch from `HashMap` to a `WeakHashMap`. If you\'re following\\nthe standard convention of referring to your maps via the Map interface, no other code needs to even be aware of the\\nchange.\\n\\nReference Queues\\n----------------\\n\\nOnce a `WeakReference` starts returning `null`, the object it pointed to has become garbage and the `WeakReference`\\nobject is pretty much useless. This generally means that some sort of cleanup is required; `WeakHashMap`, for example,\\nhas to remove such defunct entries to avoid holding onto an ever-increasing number of dead `WeakReferences`.\\n\\nThe `ReferenceQueue` class makes it easy to keep track of dead references. If you pass a `ReferenceQueue` into a weak\\nreference\'s constructor, the reference object will be automatically inserted into the reference queue when the object to\\nwhich it pointed becomes garbage. You can then, at some regular interval, process the `ReferenceQueue` and perform\\nwhatever cleanup is needed for dead references.\\n\\nDifferent Degrees of Weakness\\n-----------------------------\\n\\nUp to this point I\'ve just been referring to \\"weak references\\", but there are actually **4 degrees of reference\\nstrength** (in order from strongest to weakest):\\n\\n1. strong\\n2. soft\\n3. weak\\n4. phantom\\n\\nWe\'ve already discussed strong and weak references, so let\'s take a look at the other two.\\n\\nSoft References\\n---------------\\n\\nA **soft reference** is exactly like a weak reference, except that it is less eager to throw away the object to which it\\nrefers. An object which is only weakly reachable will be discarded at the next garbage collection cycle, but an object\\nwhich is softly reachable will generally stick around for a while.\\n\\nSoft references aren\'t required to behave any differently than weak references, but in practice softly reachable objects\\nare generally retained as long as memory is in plentiful supply. **This makes them an excellent foundation for a\\ncache**, such as the image cache described above, since you can let the garbage collector worry about both how reachable\\nthe objects are and how badly it needs the memory they are consuming.\\n\\nPhantom References\\n------------------\\n\\nA **phantom reference** is quite different than either soft reference or weak reference. Its grip on its object is so\\ntenuous that you can\'t even retrieve the object - its `get()` method always returns `null`. **The only use for such a\\nreference is keeping track of when it gets enqueued into a `ReferenceQueue`, as at that point you know the object to\\nwhich it pointed is dead**. How is that different from weak reference, though?\\n\\nThe difference is in exactly when the enqueuing happens. `WeakReferences` are enqueued as soon as the object to which\\nthey point becomes weakly reachable. This is before finalization or garbage collection has actually happened; in theory\\nthe object could even be \\"resurrected\\" by an unorthodox `finalize()` method, but the `WeakReference` would remain dead.\\n`PhantomReferences` are enqueued only when the object is physically removed from memory, and the `get()` method always\\nreturns `null` specifically to prevent you from being able to \\"resurrect\\" an almost-dead object.\\n\\nWhat good are `PhantomReferences`? I\'m only aware of two serious cases for them: first, they allow you to determine\\nexactly when an object was removed from memory. They are in fact the only way to determine that. This isn\'t generally\\nthat useful, but might come in handy in certain very specific circumstances like manipulating large images: if you know\\nfor sure that an image should be garbage collected, you can wait until it actually is before attempting to load the next\\nimage, and therefore make the dreaded `OutOfMemoryError` less likely.\\n\\nSecond, phantom references avoid a fundamental problem with finalization: `finalize()` methods can \\"resurrect\\" objects\\nby creating new strong references to them. So what, you say? Well, the problem is that an object which overrides\\n`finalize()` must now be determined to be garbage in at least two separate garbage collection cycles in order to be\\ncollected. When the first cycle determines that it is garbage, it becomes eligible for finalization. Because of the\\n(slim, but unfortunately real) possibility that the object was \\"resurrected\\" during finalization, the garbage collector\\nhas to run again before the object can actually be removed. And because finalization might not have happened in a timely\\nfashion, an arbitrary number of garbage collection cycles might have happened while the object was waiting for\\nfinalization. This can mean serious delays in actually cleaning up garbage objects, and is why you can get\\n`OutOfMemoryErrors` even when most of the heap is garbage.\\n\\nWith phantom reference, this situation is impossible -- when a `PhantomReference` is enqueued, there is absolutely no\\nway to get a pointer to the now-dead object (which is good, because it isn\'t in memory any longer). Because\\n`PhantomReference` cannot be used to resurrect an object, the object can be instantly cleaned up during the first\\ngarbage collection cycle in which it is found to be phantomly reachable. You can then dispose whatever resources you\\nneed to at your convenience.\\n\\nArguably, the `finalize()` method should never have been provided in the first place. phantom references are definitely\\nsafer and more efficient to use, and eliminating `finalize()` would have made parts of the VM considerably simpler. But,\\nthey\'re also more work to implement, so I confess to still using `finalize()` most of the time. The good news is that at\\nleast you have a choice."},{"id":"bearer-authentication","metadata":{"permalink":"/jersey-webservice-template/blog/bearer-authentication","editUrl":"https://github.com/QubitPi/jersey-webservice-template/tree/master/docs/blog/2023-11-23-bearer-authentication.md","source":"@site/blog/2023-11-23-bearer-authentication.md","title":"Bearer Authentication","description":"Bearer authentication (also called token authentication) is an","date":"2023-11-23T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"November 23, 2023","tags":[{"label":"Security","permalink":"/jersey-webservice-template/blog/tags/security"}],"readingTime":0.635,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[{"name":"Jack","title":"Maintainer of Jersey Webservice Template","url":"https://github.com/QubitPi","imageURL":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16126939?v=4","key":"jiaqi"}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"bearer-authentication","title":"Bearer Authentication","authors":"jiaqi","tags":["Security"]},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"Understanding Weak References","permalink":"/jersey-webservice-template/blog/weak-references"},"nextItem":{"title":"Tired of Null Pointer Exceptions?

Joking aside,\\nthe null reference is the source of many problems because it is often used to denote the absence of a value. Java SE 8\\nintroduces a new class called **java.util.Optional** that can alleviate some of these problems.\\n\\nDangers of Null\\n---------------\\n\\nLet\'s start with an example to see the dangers of null by considering a nested object structure for a `Computer`, as\\nillustrated in Figure below\\n\\n![Error loading java-optional-computer.png](java-optional-computer.png)\\n\\nWhat\'s possibly problematic with the following code?\\n\\n```java\\nString version = computer.getSoundcard().getUSB().getVersion();\\n```\\n\\nThis code looks pretty reasonable. However, many computers (for example, the Raspberry Pi) don\'t actually ship with a\\nsound card. So what is the result of `getSoundcard()`?\\n\\nA common (bad) practice is to return the null reference to indicate the absence of a sound card. Unfortunately, this\\nmeans the call to `getUSB()` will try to return the USB port of a null reference, which will result in a\\n`NullPointerException` at runtime and stop your program from running further. Imagine if your program was running on a\\ncustomer\'s machine; what would your customer say if the program suddenly failed?\\n\\nTo give some historical context, Tony Hoare - one of the giants of computer science - wrote, \\"I call it my\\nbillion-dollar mistake. It was the invention of the null reference in 1965. I couldn\'t resist the temptation to put in\\na null reference, simply because it was so easy to implement.\\"\\n\\nWhat can you do to prevent unintended null pointer exceptions? You can be defensive and add checks to prevent null\\ndereferences, as shown below:\\n\\n```java\\nString version = \\"UNKNOWN\\";\\nif (computer != null) {\\n    Soundcard soundcard = computer.getSoundcard();\\n    if(soundcard != null){\\n        USB usb = soundcard.getUSB();\\n        if(usb != null){\\n            version = usb.getVersion();\\n        }\\n    }\\n}\\n```\\n\\nHowever, you can see that the code quickly becomes very ugly due to the nested checks. Unfortunately, we need a lot of\\nboilerplate code to make sure we don\'t get a NullPointerException. In addition, it\'s just annoying that these checks get\\nin the way of the business logic. In fact, they are decreasing the overall readability of our program.\\n\\nFurthermore, it is an error-prone process; what if you forget to check that one property could be null? I will argue in\\nthis post that using null to represent the absence of a value is a wrong approach. What we need is a better way to\\nmodel the absence and presence of a value.\\n\\nTo give some context, let\'s briefly look at what other programming languages have to offer.\\n\\nWhat Alternatives to Null Are There\\n-----------------------------------\\n\\nLanguages such as Groovy have a _safe navigation operator_ represented by \\"?.\\" to safely navigate through potential\\nnull references. (Note that it is soon to be included in C#, too, and it was proposed for Java SE 7 but didn\'t make it\\ninto that release.) It works as follows:\\n\\n```groovy\\nString version = computer?.getSoundcard()?.getUSB()?.getVersion()\\n```\\n\\nIn this case, the variable \\"version\\" will be assigned to null if `computer` is null, or `getSoundcard()` returns null,\\nor `getUSB()` returns null. You don\'t need to write complex nested conditions to check for null.\\n\\nIn addition, Groovy also includes the _Elvis operator_ \\"?:\\" (if you look at it sideways, you\'ll recognize Elvis\' famous\\nhair), which can be used for simple cases when a default value is needed. In the following, if the expression that uses\\nthe safe navigation operator returns null, the default value \\"UNKNOWN\\" is returned; otherwise, the available version\\ntag is returned.\\n\\n```groovy\\nString version = computer?.getSoundcard()?.getUSB()?.getVersion() ?: \\"UNKNOWN\\"\\n```\\n\\nOther functional languages, such as Haskell and Scala, take a different view. Haskell includes a **Maybe** type, which\\nessentially encapsulates an optional value. A value of type Maybe can contain either a value of a given type or\\nnothing. There is no concept of a null reference. Scala has a similar construct called **Option\\\\[T\\\\]** to encapsulate\\nthe presence or absence of a value of type `T`. You then have to explicitly check whether a value is present or not\\nusing operations available on the `Option` type, which enforces the idea of \\"null checking.\\" **You can no longer\\n\\"forget to do it\\" because it is enforced by the type system**.\\n\\nJava 8 _Optional_ in a Nutshell\\n-------------------------------\\n\\nJava SE 8 introduces a new class called `java.util.Optional<T>` that is inspired from the ideas of Haskell and Scala.\\nIt is a class that encapsulates an optional value, as illustrated in figure below. You can view `Optional` as a\\nsingle-value container that either contains a value or doesn\'t (it is then said to be \\"empty\\"):\\n\\n![Error loading java-optional-eg.png](java-optional-eg.png)\\n\\nWe can update our model to make use of Optional, as shown in Listing 2:\\n\\n```java\\npublic class Computer {\\n    private Optional<Soundcard> soundcard;\\n    public Optional<Soundcard> getSoundcard() { ... }\\n    ...\\n}\\n\\npublic class Soundcard {\\n    private Optional<USB> usb;\\n    public Optional<USB> getUSB() { ... }\\n}\\n\\npublic class USB {\\n    public String getVersion(){ ... }\\n}\\n```\\n\\nThe code above immediately shows that a computer might or might not have a sound card (the sound card is optional). In\\naddition, a sound card can optionally have a USB port. This is an improvement, because this new model can now reflect\\nclearly whether a given value is allowed to be missing.\\n\\nBut what can you actually do with an `Optional<Soundcard>` object? After all, you want to get to the USB port\'s version\\nnumber. In a nutshell, the `Optional` class includes methods to explicitly deal with the cases where a value is present\\nor absent. However, the advantage compared to null references is that the `Optional` class forces us to think about the\\ncase when the value is not present. As a consequence, we can prevent unintended null pointer exceptions.\\n\\nIt is important to note that the intention of the `Optional` class is not to replace every single null reference.\\nInstead, its purpose is to help design more-comprehensible APIs so that by just reading the signature of a method, you\\ncan tell whether you can expect an optional value. This forces you to actively unwrap an `Optional` to deal with the\\nabsence of a value.\\n\\nUsing Optional\\n--------------\\n\\nThe Groovy code above can be written with Optional in Java as\\n\\n```java\\nString name = computer.flatMap(Computer::getSoundcard)\\n        .flatMap(Soundcard::getUSB)\\n        .map(USB::getVersion)\\n        .orElse(\\"UNKNOWN\\");\\n```\\n\\n### Creating Optional Objects\\n\\nFirst, how do you create Optional objects? There are several ways:\\n\\nHere is an empty Optional:\\n\\n```java\\nOptional<Soundcard> sc = Optional.empty();\\n```\\n\\nAnd here is an `Optional` with a non-null value:\\n\\n```java\\nOptional<Soundcard> sc = Optional.of(new Soundcard());\\n```\\n\\nIn the case above, if soundcard were null, a NullPointerException would be immediately thrown (rather than getting a\\nlatent error once you try to access properties of the soundcard)\\n\\nBy using **ofNullable**, however, you can create an Optional object that may hold a null value:\\n\\n```java\\nOptional<Soundcard> sc = Optional.ofNullable(soundcard);\\n```\\n\\nIf soundcard were null, the resulting `Optional` object would be empty.\\n\\n### Do Something If a Value Is Present\\n\\nNow that you have an Optional object, you can access the methods available to explicitly deal with the presence or\\nabsence of values. Instead of having to remember to do a null check, as follows:\\n\\n```java\\nSoundCard soundcard = ...;\\nif(soundcard != null){\\n    System.out.println(soundcard);\\n}\\n```\\n\\nYou can use the **ifPresent()** method, as follows:\\n\\n```java\\nOptional<Soundcard> soundcard = ...;\\nsoundcard.ifPresent(System.out::println);\\n```\\n\\nYou no longer need to do an explicit null check; it is enforced by the type system. If the Optional object were empty,\\nnothing would be printed.\\n\\nYou can also use the **isPresent()** method to find out whether a value is present in an Optional object. In addition,\\nthere\'s a **get()** method that returns the value contained in the Optional object, if it is present. _Otherwise,\\nit throws a NoSuchElementException_. The two methods can be combined, as follows, to prevent exceptions:\\n\\n```java\\nif(soundcard.isPresent()){\\n    System.out.println(soundcard.get());\\n}\\n```\\n\\nHowever, this is not the recommended use of Optional because it\'s not much of an improvement over nested null checks,\\nand there are more idiomatic alternatives, which we explore below.\\n\\n### Default Values and Actions\\n\\nA typical pattern is to return a default value if you determine that the result of an operation is null. In general,\\nyou can use the ternary operator, as follows, to achieve this:\\n\\n```java\\nSoundcard soundcard = maybeSoundcard != null ? maybeSoundcard : new Soundcard(\\"basic_sound_card\\");\\n```\\n\\nUsing an Optional object, you can rewrite this code by using the **orElse()** method, which provides a default value if\\nOptional is empty:\\n\\n```java\\nSoundcard soundcard = maybeSoundcard.orElse(new Soundcard(\\"defaut\\"));\\n```\\n\\nSimilarly, you can use the **orElseThrow()** method, which instead of providing a default value if Optional is empty,\\nthrows an exception:\\n\\n```java\\nSoundcard soundcard = maybeSoundCard.orElseThrow(IllegalStateException::new);\\n```\\n\\n### Rejecting Certain Values Using the filter Method\\n\\nOften you need to call a method on an object and check some property. For example, you might need to check whether the\\nUSB port is a particular version. To do this in a safe way, you first need to check whether the reference pointing to a\\nUSB object is null and then call the `getVersion()` method, as follows:\\n\\n```java\\nUSB usb = ...;\\nif(usb != null && \\"3.0\\".equals(usb.getVersion())){\\n    System.out.println(\\"ok\\");\\n}\\n```\\n\\nThis pattern can be rewritten using the **filter** method on an Optional object, as follows:\\n\\n```java\\nOptional<USB> maybeUSB = ...;\\nmaybeUSB.filter(usb -> \\"3.0\\".equals(usb.getVersion()).ifPresent(() -> System.out.println(\\"ok\\"));\\n```\\n\\nThe `filter` method takes a predicate as an argument. If a value is present in the `Optional` object and it matches the\\npredicate, the filter method returns that value; otherwise, it returns an empty `Optional` object.\\n\\n### Extracting and Transforming Values Using the map Method\\n\\nAnother common pattern is to extract information from an object. For example, from a `Soundcard` object, you might want\\nto extract the USB object and then further check whether it is of the correct version. You would typically write the\\nfollowing code:\\n\\n```java\\nif(soundcard != null){\\n    USB usb = soundcard.getUSB();\\n    if(usb != null && \\"3.0\\".equals(usb.getVersion()){\\n        System.out.println(\\"ok\\");\\n    }\\n}\\n```\\n\\nWe can rewrite this pattern of \\"checking for null and extracting\\" (here, the `Soundcard` object) using the map method.\\n\\n```java\\nOptional<USB> usb = maybeSoundcard.map(Soundcard::getUSB);\\n```\\n\\nThere\'s a direct parallel to the `map` method used with streams. There, you pass a function to the `map` method, which\\napplies this function to each element of a stream. However, nothing happens if the stream is empty. The `map` method of\\nthe `Optional` class does exactly the same: the value contained inside `Optional` is \\"transformed\\" by the function\\npassed as an argument (here, a method reference to extract the USB port), while nothing happens if `Optional` is empty.\\n\\nFinally, we can combine the `map` method with the `filter` method to reject a USB port whose version is different than\\n3.0:\\n\\n```java\\nmaybeSoundcard.map(Soundcard::getUSB)\\n        .filter(usb -> \\"3.0\\".equals(usb.getVersion())\\n        .ifPresent(() -> System.out.println(\\"ok\\"));\\n```\\n\\n### Cascading Optional Objects Using the flatMap Method\\n\\nWe\'ve seen a few patterns that can be refactored to use Optional. So how can we write the following code in a safe way?\\n\\n```java\\nString version = computer.getSoundcard().getUSB().getVersion();\\n```\\n\\nNotice that all this code does is extract one object from another one, which is exactly what the map method is for.\\nEarlier in the article, we changed our model so a Computer has an `Optional<Soundcard>` and a Soundcard has an\\n`Optional<USB>`, so we should be able to write the following:\\n\\n```java\\nString version = computer.map(Computer::getSoundcard)\\n        .map(Soundcard::getUSB)\\n        .map(USB::getVersion)\\n        .orElse(\\"UNKNOWN\\");\\n```\\n\\nUnfortunately, this code doesn\'t compile. Why? The variable computer is of type `Optional<Computer>`, so it is\\nperfectly correct to call the `map` method. However, `getSoundcard()` returns an object of type `Optional<Soundcard>`.\\nThis means the result of the `map` operation is an object of type `Optional<Optional<Soundcard>>`. As a result, the\\ncall to `getUSB()` is invalid because the outermost Optional contains as its value another Optional, which of course\\ndoesn\'t support the `getUSB()` method\\n\\nSo how can we solve this problem? Again, we can look at a pattern you might have used previously with streams: the\\n**flatMap** method. With streams, the `flatMap` method takes a function as an argument, which returns another stream.\\nThis function is applied to each element of a stream, which would result in a stream of streams. However, `flatMap` has\\nthe effect of replacing each generated stream by the contents of that stream. In other words, all the separate streams\\nthat are generated by the function get amalgamated or \\"flattened\\" into one single stream. What we want here is\\nsomething similar, but we want to \\"flatten\\" a two-level Optional into one.\\n\\nWell, here\'s good news: `Optional` also supports a `flatMap` method. Its purpose is to apply the transformation\\nfunction on the value of an `Optional` and then flatten the resulting two-level Optional into a single one.\\n\\nSo, to make our code correct, we need to rewrite it as follows using `flatMap`:\\n\\n```java\\nString version = computer.flatMap(Computer::getSoundcard)\\n        .flatMap(Soundcard::getUSB)\\n        .map(USB::getVersion)\\n        .orElse(\\"UNKNOWN\\");\\n```\\n\\nThe first flatMap ensures that an `Optional<Soundcard>` is returned instead of an `Optional<Optional<Soundcard>>`, and\\nthe second flatMap achieves the same purpose to return an `Optional<USB>`. Note that the third call just needs to be a\\nmap() because getVersion() returns a String rather than an `Optional` object."},{"id":"restassured-json","metadata":{"permalink":"/jersey-webservice-template/blog/restassured-json","editUrl":"https://github.com/QubitPi/jersey-webservice-template/tree/master/docs/blog/2023-11-19-restassured-json.md","source":"@site/blog/2023-11-19-restassured-json.md","title":"(RestAssured) Match JSON Ignoring Order","description":"Use RestAssured\'s JsonPath to parse the JSON file into a Map and then compare it with Hamcrest Matchers.

For example, on Linux, we use\\n\\n```bash\\nexport MY_ENV_VAR=foo\\n```\\n\\n_When creating a process, it inherits a clone environment of its parent process by default_.\\n\\nTo obtain a single environment variable programmatically, we can call **getenv** with the variable name:\\n\\n```java\\nString log_dir = System.getenv(\\"log_dir\\");\\n```\\n\\n:::caution\\n\\ngetenv() returns a _read-only_ Map. Trying to add values to the map throws an UnsupportedOperationException.\\n\\n:::\\n\\nThe Differences\\n---------------\\n\\nAlthough both are essentially maps that provide String values for String keys, let\'s look at a few differences:\\n\\n1. We can update Properties at runtime, while Environment Variables are an immutable copy of the Operating System\'s\\n   variables.\\n2. Properties are contained only within the Java platform, while Environment Variables are global at the Operating\\n   System level, available to all applications running on the same machine.\\n3. Properties must exist when packaging the application, but we can create Environment Variables on the Operating\\n   System at almost any point."}]}')}}]);
